        The mission: to terraform web3. An ecosystem powered by developers,

        A collection of 10,000 crew members, primed for the genesis mission
        launch. Onboard, crew members will have access to epic shared
        experiences, meaningful collabs, one of a kind NFT drops, and a future
        built for the community over time. With the focus on empowering Web3
        entrepreneurship the ecosystem will fill the underlying gaps on
        contribution with incentivized exchange of utility. Each of us will have
        a role to play.
